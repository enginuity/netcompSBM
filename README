netcomp_sbm
===========

R and C++ code for fitting SBMs

NOTE: All the code herein will assume that the working directory is THIS base directory (where this README file resides)

-------------------------
Files in base directory: 
compile_package.R -- This R script will rebuild the package
load_library.R -- This script loads the netcomp_sbm package and dependency packages
load_source.R -- This script loads the functions in the netcomp_sbm package into the global directory (by running 'source' on the source code files)

-------------------------
Directory Structure: 

netcomp_sbm/ -- This folder contains all the functions (and source) for this package. 

sbm1.1/ -- This is the original C++ code by Aurelien Decelle, Florent Krzakala, Lenka Zdeborova and Pan Zhang, and *should not* be modified (just here for reference). There is a README in that folder.
